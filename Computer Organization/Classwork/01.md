## Von Neuman Architecture:
Data and instructions are stored in the same part of the memory

![![[CPUblock-660x495.jpg]]]

1. Control Unit:  Decides the order in which the instructions are executed.
	- Timing Signal:
	- Control Signal: 
2. ALU:
	- Controls all **arithmetic** and **logical** operations
3. Memory:
	- Program Counter
	- Main Memory
	- External Memory
	- Accumulator
4. Register: Stores less memory but extremely fast execution time, faster than the main memory.

### Considering a system memory of size 4096 ($2^{12}$)x 16 words
- Address Register
- Data Register
- Accumulator
- Program Counter Register. (Also one type of address register holding the address of the next instruction to be executed)
- Instruction Register -> Instructions(1 bit), OpCode(3 bit) and Operator (12 bit).
- Input and Output Registers: 8 bit each
## Types of Instructions:
- Data Transfer Instruction.
- Data Manipulation.
- Program Control Transfer.

### Data Transfer Instructions
MOVE: MOV R1,R2 // Moves register R2 to R1
LOAD: LD R1 500
STORE STA
EXCHANGE: XHANGE
PUSH
POP

### Data Manipulation:
1. Arithmetic
	- ADD
	- SUBS
	- MUL
	- DIV
	- INCREMENT
	- DECREMENT
2. Logical
	- AND
	- OR
	- COMPLEMENT
	- XOR
	- NOR
	- CLRC
	- STC
	- CMC
	- EI (Enable Interrupt)
	- DI (Disable Interrupt)
	- JUMP
	- GOTO
3. Shift
	- LEFTSHIFT
	- RIGHTSHIFT
	- ARITHMETIC SHIFT LEFT
	- ARITHMETIC SHIFT RIGHT
