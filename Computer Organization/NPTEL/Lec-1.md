## Basic Components of a Computer System:

- **Processor**: Generally consists of **Data path** circuits and **Control** circuits.
- **Memory**: **Interacts Directly With CPU** and **Storage is connected to CPU but not interacting directly**. Memory is closer to the CPU (RAM) and Storage devices like HDD and Magnetic Tapes are called Storage.
- I/O Devices (This can be considered as extended memory): Provides data to the memory and CPU. **Data can come from either external input from the user or get data from explicitly stored data in the memory**. Since both do the same work of providing data, thus, **I/O devices are called extended storage**.

### Application Spectrum of Computer Organization:

Major viewpoints of CO:
- Control : Electrical Engineer viewpoint-> (Special Purpose)-> ROM-> Hardware Oriented.
- Data Processing: Computer Scientist viewpoint-> (General Purpose)-> RAM-> Software Oriented.

### Processing:
- Numeric Processing: Used to process numbers
- Arithmetic Processing: Extended from numeric Processing
- Symbolic processing: String processing, involves logic processing
###### The core of processing in a CPU is the **ALU: Arithmetic Logic Unit** .

#### Overview of how the computer works:
High Level Language -> Assembler -> Machine Code
