### Definition: 
(Classical Set theory)
A well defined collection of distinct objects is called a set when the objects are independent of order of their arrangement.
### Representation:
- Set-builder form: A = {x : x for x $\in$ N, 0 < x <12 and x is divisible by 2}.
- Tabular / Roster form: A = {2,4,6,,8,10}. 
### Common Notations:
- N -> Set of all natural numbers.
- Z${^+}$ -> Set of all positive integers.
- Z${^-}$ -> Set of all negative integers.
- Z / I -> Set of all integers = Z${^+} \space \cup \space$ Z$^-$ $\cup$ {0}.
- Q -> Set of all rational numbers:
	- Conditions for rational numbers:
	1. p/q where p and q are integers
	2. q != 0
	3. p and q should be co-prime
- Q' -> Set of all irrational numbers.
- R -> Set of all real numbers.
- C -> Set of all complex number 
- $\forall$ -> For all.
- $\in$ -> Belongs to.

## Properties and Types of Set:
- Cardinality: Number of elements in a set is called it's cardinality.
#### Types of sets based on cardinality:
- Null Set: no elements in this set, represented by $\emptyset$
- Singleton Set: Set with a single element.
- Finite and Infinite Set: Finite -> Fixed number of elements. Infinite -> Constantly expanding set.
## Subset:
If A, B are 2 sets such that all elements of A is also an element of V, then A is said to be a subset of B, i.e. A $\subset$ B or A is contained in B.
Ex: A = {i,o} B = {a,e,i,o,u} then A $\subset$ B
### Proper Subset: 
Norma definition of subset : A $\subset$ B
### Improper Subset: 
From the definition of subset, we know that A is a subset of itself. Here A is called an improper subset. i.e. A contains all the elements of A only and nothing more than that.
Represented by: A $\subseteq$ A
## Theorems on Subset:
- **If A $\subseteq$ B and B $\subseteq$ A the A = B.**
- **If A $\subseteq$ B and B $\subseteq$ C the A $\subseteq$ C.**
## Power Set:
If S is any set, then the set of all subsets of S is called the power set of S, denoted by P(S).
Ex: If A = {1,2,3} then,
**P(S) = {{1},{2},{3},{1,2},{2,3},{1,3},{1,2,3}, $\emptyset$ }**
**Cardinality of power set: 2$^{|n|}$ where n is the cardinality of the main set, here A**
