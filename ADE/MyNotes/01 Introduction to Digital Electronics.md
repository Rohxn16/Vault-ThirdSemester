### Need for digital electronics: To process analog signals into discrete values to convert the data into human readable / usable information
Analog Signals ( #analog ) are converted into digital by measuring their amplitude of the signal in periods of time, making them fall under a certain threshold range and  converting it to the associated value in the range, which is generally in binary number system because the presence of signal is discrete and is measured by 0s or 1s.

### Manipulation of Digital Signals:
Switching is the most basic example of manipulation of #digital signal data. It is a binary activity, ON and OFF.
An advanced example of this concept's application would be #multiplexer, a device that takes in multiple sets of inputs (Data and Control) and produces a single output.  

## Gates:
#gates are applications of different kinds circuits used to manipulate digital data. These are the building blocks of a digital circuit.

For example, the **AND** gate is basically a **series** circuit where both terminals need to be closed in order to allow the electricity to flow, while the **OR** gate is basically a **parallel** circuit. This can be verified from their truth tables.
And finally the **NOT** gate is a basic alternating switch that just becomes the opposite of what the input given to it is.

### Tristate:
#tristate is a special condition in #digital circuits where there is an extra input, G, which only when high connects and completes the circuit, or else leaves the circuit open.
