### Q. A machine costing rupees 5 lakh purchased on  1.6.22 . Cost of installation is Rupees 40,000 on 1.10.2023, a second machine costed rupees 4 lakh was purchased and the carrying cost was Rupees 10,000. Calculate the amount of depreciation on 31st march 2025. The rate of depreciation being 10% p.a.

### Ans.
Original Cost = paid price + installation price.
$\therefore$ Cost = 5,00,000 + 40,000 = 5,40,000.
## Method 1: Normal Method
### Depreciation under SLM = (OC - SV) / 100, where S.V. is the salvage value of the item and OC is the original cost. or dep =  $x$ % of Original Cost.
The time between the given two time points is 10 months.
$\therefore$ ATP, we need to find the depreciation for 10 months of the machine, @ 10% per annum.
5,40,000 $\times$ 10/100 $\times$ 10/12 = 45,000. (depreciation for the first year).

$\implies$ For year 1 (first 10 months), Written Down Value (WDV) = O.C. - Depreciation = 5,40,000 - 45,000 = 4,95,000.
$\implies$ For year 2 (full year), WDV = O.C. - Depreciation = 4,95,000 - (10/100 $\times$ O.C)
$\implies$ WDV = 4,95,000 - 49,500 =  4,41,000.

## Method 2: Reducing Balance Method
O.C. = 4,10,000 || Date of Buying = 1.10.23 to 31.3.25
<hr>
1.10.23 = 30.9.23.
$\therefore$ Dep = 410000 $\times$ 10/100 $\times$ 6/12 = 20,500.
$\implies$ WDV = OC - Dep = 4,10,000 - 20,500 = 3,89,000.
For next year,
$\implies$ WDV = 389500 - 38950  = 3,50,550                       // {10 % dep}
